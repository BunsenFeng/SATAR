### SATAR: A Self-supervised Approach to Twitter Account Representation Learning and its Application in Bot Detection
This repository serves as a code listing for the paper 'SATAR: A Self-supervised Approach to Twitter Account Representation Learning and its Application in Bot Detection'.

#### Affiliated Paper
The affiliated paper, "SATAR: A Self-supervised Approach to Twitter Account Representation Learning and its Application in Bot Detection" is currently under review at CIKM'21. 

#### Code Listing
Codes of experiments on TwiBot-20 and two other datasets are listed in ./exp1_bot_detection/ and the name of the folders are correspondes to the methods respectively. Codes of ablation study and results are in ./exp2_ablation_study/ . Codes for data pre-processing are in ./data_preprocessing/ .

#### TwiBot-20 Dataset
TwiBot-20 is a comprehensive sample of the Twittersphere and it is representative of the current generation of Twitter bots and genuine users. It is naturally divided into four domains: politics, business, entertainment and sports and each user has semantics, property and neiborhood information. You can find more information about Twibot-20 in the paper 'SATAR: A Self-supervised Approach to Twitter Account Representation Learning and its Application in Bot Detection' or visit https://github.com/GabrielHam/TwiBot-20.

We provide an example of Twibot-20 in the folder "Twibot-20" and the link of the whole dataset. If you want to download and use the whole dataset, please contact us via email xxx@yy.com to obtain permission due to privacy issues.(currently anonymous for that the paper is under review)
