","23/ And best of all, it takes away the biased, limited way of thinking that we humans have. The most amazing thing is when the system finds a way to improve your model based on a dataset that you would have never thought of on your own. I’ve seen it happen and it’s wild.
","22/ Given a model, Explorium scours the mass of data sources &amp; automatically surfaces the most relevant, most predictive data products out there. You can quickly sort thru tens of thousands of answers, most of which you didn’t know existed, &amp; bring them right into your model.
","21/ Today - when you ask a question in google - it answers with the top, most informative and most relevant pages. From billions of page options, even the ones (most of the ones) that you didn’t know actually existed. The same concept could and should be applied to data science.
","20/ Let me try another analogy: Before search engines, it was tougher to find stuff. There were a huge variety of valuable sites, but they were not organized in an approachable way to get what you needed. You couldn’t leverage the info &amp; and worse, you had to know where to look.
","19/ Once I saw it, I realized the huge implications for data scientists, for risk and fraud officers, for data and analytics leaders, for marketing leaders and for companies in general. The product gives you an answer to: “how can we make it better?”
","18/ The demo of the live product is insanely great: https://t.co/0sBRkYL69V and it made us want to invest on the spot.
","17/ This is what Explorium does. It is an automated data science platform that connects you to the data you need for better decision making. My simple mind calls it “an appstore for data” but, there may be better ways to describe it.
","16/ You need a way to test this data on your predictive model to see if it shows uplift, and then easily subscribe/pay for this dataset that you deem makes a difference for your data model. You also want reliability in the data quality.
","15/ You need a way browse the catalog of *tens of thousands* of public datasets, get recommendations of which of those datasets might be able to help, allowing the data scientist or the analyst to select from verified high quality data providers…
","14/ Like the Appstore example, there is a need to organize against this data science problem...
","13/ The finance institution could be using other signals: did they get government funding (public dataset) so it has a better chance of surviving? Is the business selling online or not? All things you can get through data feeds.
","12/ As we're seeing around us - that no longer is relevant to judging whether a SMB will be a good credit risk.
","11/ Here’s another example: Small business lending. If you are a financial institution, when you grant credit, you use financial signals to drive your risk model. Things like revenue growth, spend, etc.
","10/ Being able to quickly find and utilize the right data will enable you as a retailer to not only adapt very quickly - but to be predictive and possibly even gain market share.
","9/ Instead a myriad of external signals are now more impactful. Maybe it’s covid cases around you, maybe it is the number of competitors going out of business, the state restrictions, the general age of the population you’re in, or a ton of other datasets.
","8/ Here are a couple real examples of why this matters... Let’s say you have a retail store. The world has changed on you so fast that your old internal data and patterns (your “historical sales” data) are totally irrelevant.
","7/ So, brings up an interesting question: Could you do the same with data (not the PII kind, but the public kind)? Could you create an app store for data? An appstore for data that lets you discover/browse and be recommended datasets that you can install right into your model.
","6/ Bad analogy alert! This is sort of the same problem that the App Stores have solved: they helped organize the world of apps to make them easier to discover, and have a system to make them easily testable, installable and usable, and enabled flow.
","5/ And w COVID, it may be that your own internal data may not even be as relevant as it once was, since “everything’s different now.”
","4/ This is especially hard because the right data may not be obvious to you. And your own data may have some implicit bias. Actually, just the process of you being aware of some datasets and unaware of others means there might be bias in your model.
","3/ But, finding this data is not easy. You can’t just go shopping at the dataset store. There’s no recommendation engine for what to even try. How do you find and test the best public and premium datasets to improve your models? At best, you guess &amp; try to find a feed provider.
","2/ You already know this: data is one of an organization's biggest assets. We've all witnessed that for the past decade. Companies should constantly chase better, more relevant data, just as they chase revenue. Those that have the right data have a competitive advantage.
","A year ago, I met Maor from https://t.co/qkAlVJvqQb who showed me the best live product demo I’d ever seen. It opened my eyes to what is key in Data Science. As a customer said: Explorium enables their company, which was blind, to see…(long thread ahead!) https://t.co/vSXc5Gi5Q6

Also like monitoring, what else could be done w live data to change experience -there's already an API
","@seacue I hope that the teams responsible for physical space now have more budget and authority than before to help drive the change. Hoping the companies have given them a primary directive. Are you seeing this?
","Of course, Covid is helping accelerating the need &amp; pace of timeline of this work-environment modernization. It is bringing forward all these important questions about the employees' relationship to their work space.
","There was already a macro trend of modernization in work spaces. Meaningful work to modernize buildings has been going on at least half a decade.
But there's more of a push now.
Products like @densityio should help companies better execute this idea of a modern environment.
","In many businesses, the top expense lines include employees &amp; office footprint. Yet most are oblivious of *how* they connect -- how employees occupy the work/warehouse/office footprint. In a world of data-driven decision making, it's wild there was such a big knowledge gap... https://t.co/IOGiokIP79

","We’ve seen the power that our voices have when we speak out about injustice––but we also know the toll that it takes on our mental health. Today, I talked to @repjohnlewis, Bryan Stevenson, and @MBK_Alliance activists about ways to keep our mental health a priority at this time. https://t.co/PAsWb607EU
","On National Gun Violence Awareness Day, we #WearOrange to honor the victims and survivors of gun violence––which continues to disproportionately harm Black communities. Then keep speaking up, voting, and changing laws across the country.
","Third, every city in this country should be a @MBK_Alliance community. We have 250 cities, counties, and tribal nations working to reduce barriers and expand opportunity for boys and young men of color. Join us: https://t.co/RZRwimA3SO
","Second, every mayor should review their use of force policies with members of their community and commit to report on planned reforms. We need mayors, county executives, and those in positions of power to make this a priority. Take the pledge: https://t.co/c8pAlhJsPJ
","First, there are specific evidence-based reforms that would build trust, save lives, and lead to a decrease in crime, too. You can find clear, actionable recommendations right here: https://t.co/V7b0mJoZiL
","Real change requires protest to highlight a problem, and politics to implement practical solutions and laws. As I mentioned yesterday in our @MBK_Alliance town hall, there are several steps our mayors and elected officials can take right now:
","In our @MBK_Alliance town hall yesterday, I mentioned James Baldwin's The Fire Next Time. From 1962, it remains a seminal meditation on race by one of our greatest writers and relevant for understanding the pain and anger behind the protests. Excerpt: https://t.co/50F9ZP3JhQ
","And third, an extraordinary essay by the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces, Mike Mullen, explaining the values at risk when we start using our military to control domestic protests.

","Second, a reminder of the difference politics and voting can make in changing who has the power to make real change in a community like Ferguson with a history of blatant discriminatory law enforcement practices.

https://t.co/U0z9wMOx8z
","Here’s a useful read––a reminder of the importance of de-escalation by police in their interactions with protestors.

https://t.co/Ondw85gQNL
","""Let’s do this another way. Let's stop thinking our voice don’t matter and vote. Not just for the president...educate yourself and know who you’re voting for. And that’s how we're going to hit 'em."" https://t.co/WX6oLNRtI2
","Let’s get to work. https://t.co/jEczrOeFdv
","I know the past few months have been hard and dispiriting. But watching the heightened activism of young people makes me hopeful. And if we can keep channeling our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action, this can be the moment when real change starts.
","If you want to take concrete action, but you’re not sure how, we’ve created a site to connect you with useful resources and organizations who’ve been fighting the good fight at the local and national levels for years. https://t.co/2KcB4T3b0I
","5. The more specific we can make demands for criminal justice and police reform, the harder it will be for elected officials to just offer lip service to the cause and then fall back into business as usual once protests have gone away.
","4. So if we want to bring about real change, the choice isn’t between protest and politics––we have to do both. We have to mobilize to raise awareness, and we have to organize and cast our ballots to make sure that we elect candidates who will act on reform.
","3. To do that, we have to know which levels of government have the biggest impact. Changing the federal government is important. But the elected officials who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system work at the state and local levels.
","2. The point of protest is to raise public awareness, to put a spotlight on injustice, and to make the powers that be uncomfortable. But eventually, we have to translate those aspirations into specific laws and institutional practices.
","1. The protests represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system. We should condemn the few who resort to violence––not the overwhelming majority who deserve our respect and support.
","Ultimately, it’s going to be up to a new generation of activists to shape strategies that best fit the times. But I want to highlight some basic lessons from past efforts that are worth remembering:
","As millions of people across the country take to the streets and raise their voices in response to the killing of George Floyd and the ongoing problem of unequal justice, I’ve heard many ask how we can sustain momentum to bring about real change.
","I wrote out some thoughts on how to make this moment a real turning point to bring about real change––and pulled together some resources to help young activists sustain the momentum by channeling their energy into concrete action. https://t.co/jEczrOeFdv

","This pandemic has painfully brought to the surface many of the reasons I launched @MBK_Alliance—structural racism robs too many of our kids of their futures.

","We are grateful for what he did for this country. He carried the baton longer and surer than almost anybody. It falls to the rest of us now to pick it up and never stop moving forward until we finish what he started—that journey to justice.
","What a joy it was to watch him pray and preach. I took heart in him saying, “We ain’t going back. We’ve come too far, marched too long, prayed too hard, wept too bitterly, bled too profusely, and died too young to let anybody turn back the clock on our journey to justice.”
","Rev. Joseph Lowery was a giant who let so many of us stand on his shoulders. With boundless generosity, patience, and moral courage, he encouraged a new generation of activists and leaders.
